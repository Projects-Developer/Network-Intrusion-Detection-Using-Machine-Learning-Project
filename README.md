## Abstract: 
The Network Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning Project develops a machine learning-based system for detecting network intrusions. The project collects network traffic data, extracts relevant features, and trains machine learning models to identify potential security threats. The system detects network intrusions in real-time, generates alerts, and provides insights for incident response and network security monitoring.

Keywords: Network Intrusion Detection, Machine Learning, Network Security, Cybersecurity, Threat Detection, Anomaly Detection
